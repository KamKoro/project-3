# [B-Side Music App - Frontend]

![App Screenshot]

## Overview
B-Side Music is a full-stack music catalogue and playlist manager that allows users to create, customise, and share playlists.  
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their personal library of songs.  
I built this project to practice full CRUD functionality, authentication/authorisation, and to strengthen my MERN stack skills.
